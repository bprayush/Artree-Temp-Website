                                Sheelasha Rajbhandari is a visual artist based in Kathmandu.Her mixed media installations depicts the parallel - yet, often contradictory - existence of traditional beliefs and historic ideas with contemporary events and evolving lifestyles. Her recent works explores how Nepal is transforming;from once being an important centre for trans-Himalayan trade, Nepal’s geopolitics now lies in flux between two emerging world powers of India and China. Rajbhandari is interested in reflecting these social, economical, political past and present through dialogues and explorations of personal/collective memories. She is interested in learning alternative histories like folktales, folklore, legends,oral histories, mythologies etc along with reference of mainstream history.Her artworks usually juxtapose these contradictions and attempt to synthesise the knowledge and experiences that result from these varied discourses.
                                <br /><br />
                                She also expresses the power struggle through gender perspective.She frequently tries to encounter the  taboos and simple yet socially forbidden subject matters through her artwork .
                                <br /><br />
                                Rajbhandari is very careful about choosing materials and methods that align with her conceptual framework. She prefers mediums and material that add meaning to ideas and have their own significance.
                                <br /><br />
