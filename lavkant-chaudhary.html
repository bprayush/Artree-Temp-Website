                                Lavkant Chaudhary's work is inspired by socio-political issues, perhaps because he grew up listening to conversations between his father (who was a farmer and an activist) and various socially prominent individuals. While studying for his BFA and living in Kathmandu, he used to teach in high school. As a result, he was inspired by his student's energy, curiosity and enthusiasm to learn. However, he realized that due the prevalence of child labor in our society, a majority of the students could not pursue their academic interests. He thus dedicated his graduation project to stories of children from different classes of society.
                                <br /><br />
                                In the aftermath of the devastating April, 2015 earthquakes , he worked on a project (as part of "Camp.Hub, Baisakh 12" organized by Artree Nepal) that allowed him to work with the local children in the Thulo Byasi community, and learn about local traditions and the craft of mask making. The culminating project , titled "Vadakuti" , incorporated local materials, stories and memoirs og the children as they related to the earthquakes. This immersive process compelled him to compare and reflect on his own growth as an individual and as an artist. He realized that he wanted to focus on issues related to one's identity, environment and cultural traditions.

                                Lavkant  Chaudhary received his BFA from Tribhuwan Univesity's Lalit Kala Campus .
