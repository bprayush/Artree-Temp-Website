                                Hit Man Gurung is a multimedia artist based in Kathmandu. His body of work is a direct response to some of the most pressing socio-political issues of the country. Most of Hit Man’s artwork addresses mass migration and haphazard urban development, aspects that are consequences of the ten year Maoist civil war and a reflection of an unstable, apathetic government. Deeply concerned about the impact of these larger forces on individuals, communities and societies. Hit Man infuses his paintings, documentary photo collage and installation work with political conviction and personal poetry.
                                <br /><br />
                                His recent series of work deals with Nepali migrant laborers who leave their families and country to join transitory work forces in foreign countries. International migration has increased exponentially since the civil war, causing disconnections between generations and altering structures of towns and villages. This trend has had a direct impact on traditional knowledge chains and local economies. These series highlight both the ensuing emotional landscape and the altered socio-economic realities.
