                                Subas Tamang comes  from a family of traditional stone carvers. He enjoys carving, engraving and different forms of printmaking. He belongs to the indigenous Tamsaling community, much of whose history is based on oral narrative traditions that are not well-documented. Because of this historic information gap, he seeks to archive the cultural and social fabrics of his and other communities. Subas employs traditional skills that he has inherited and learned over time and uses them in his artwork to make them more interactive and meaningful . He  also incorporates  multimedia techniques and different technologies and is always open to experiment with new media and collaborations.
