                            This series of works depicts the refugee crisis of the current time, which is the highest after the 2nd world war. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in 2017, 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide because of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations alone.
                            <br /><br />
                            Every day thousands of people crosses the Mediterranean Sea to European Countries mostly from Syria , Afghanistan ,Iraq and African countries.
                            According to the International Organization of Migration (IOM) for the third quarter of 2017 recorded 146,287 total arrivals to Europe, of which 137,771 were by sea. This is less than half the total recorded by the end of September 2016.Thousands of refugees die by sinking, starvation, disease etc during their journey.

While the villages are emptying the cities is densely populated as Kathmandu valley being the center for education and health. There is a sort of space in the Kathmandu so the rent of the room is very expensive. Rental money been very expensive have been the good of income for most of the house owners of valley. So the traditional houses rich in architectural value and old civilization is being continuously demolished and divided into smaller parts because of parental property rights that prevails in the country. As there is no space left the divided sec.This is hostile reality of the ancestral property has been dividing among the brothers of the family and the century old heritages of the country.

                            Subas's works are based on photographs taken by Volkmar Wentzel in 1949.The photographs capture a moment in history when mercedes car was hand carried by group of men on a rocky,hilly trail from Bhimphedi to Kathmandu . Surround by hills Kathmandu valley,capital of Nepal was the only city with modern road.
                            <br /><br />
                            Subas wants to look at this photographs through Tamang people's perspective as most of the people carrying the car belong to Tamang community.He thinks his photograph is evidence of the dark side of that time .How ruling class and the elites who imported the cars were not interested in the development of the country but were only focused to fulfill their own luxury . And from generations to generations communities like Tamsaling had to pay the price of their luxury and its impact can be seen till this date. This artwork "Study of History" is an attempt to understand, rediscover and reinterpret Subas's communal history.image references : #VolkmarWentzel

                            TAMASUK is about systematical enslavement and unfair treatment towards the indigenous Tharu community by the government through the introduction of Muluki Ain( Nation’s Code1910 BS), Land Reformation act (2021 BS) etc .Tharus were categorized as Masinya Jaat(enslavable caste) .Tharus are native to the southern part of Nepal but during the regime of autocratic rulers their lands were distributed and rewarded to different royal administrators and burocrats that left the Tharu landless in their own place.Kamaiya and kamalari system was introduced in which Tharu Men and women could be treated as commodity .They could be owned, bought ,sold and exploited by “higher cast” landlords to work on the fields same as oxen or other farm livestocks.
                            <br /><br />
                            This system was officially abolished yet till current date the Tharu Community is fighting for their basic rights.

                            Every year, thousands of people are affected by the flood in Nepal and surrounding region.Though floods are not new to the region, factors like deforestation, global warming, unplanned constructions & settlements, short sighted policies and other human/natural factors are causing the effects of flood to increase dramatically.
                            <br /><br />
                            In Southern part of Nepal at the bank of Koshi river there is a place called Barahachhetra meaning place of Varaha. According to hindu mythology, a demon named Hiranyaksha submerged entire world in the primordial ocean causing the great flood .Varaha (the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu ) took the form of a wild boar, killed the demon and retrieved the Earth from the ocean, lifting her on his tusks. It is believed that Varaha rested at the Barahachetra after saving the earth. Barahachhetra is very important hindu pilgrimage site and it is one of the 4 chhetra in hindu mythology.
                            <br /><br />
                            But ironically, Koshi river’s floods affect about 21,000 km2 (8,100 sq mi) of fertile agricultural lands , kills hundreds , injures and displaces thousands of people annually. In 2008 flood approximately 2.7 million people were affected in Nepal and India. Despite of the predictable floods there has not been sustainable solutions for this natural disaster. Causing inevitable cycle of sorrow to the helpless people living in those areas.
